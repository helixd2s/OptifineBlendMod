# Optifine blend modes config mini-mod (Fabric)

## What is it?

This is mod, that works through Optifabric and mixins with Optifine. This is Fabric mod. NOT Forge. Currently here is only source code. In any time code may to be updated, and `.jar` will outdated. 

### `shaders.properties`

I added those really working options.

```
blend.<program>.<0-7>=<off|src dst srcA dstA>
```
